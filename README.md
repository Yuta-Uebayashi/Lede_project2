# 🗾 Lede Project 2

This is the second project I’ve worked on at [Lede](https://yuta-uebayashi.github.io/Lede_project2/).

## 🏷️ Title  
**More Foreign Residents, But Is Japan Changing?**

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project investigates the rise in foreign residents across Japan’s municipalities amid an aging population and declining birthrate.  
Using interactive maps and storytelling, it explores regional variation, economic impact, and the role of foreign labor in reshaping communities—from ski towns in Hokkaido to farming villages in Nagano and tourist resorts in Okinawa.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Japan's overall population is declining, but the number of foreign residents is increasing.
- The number of municipalities with foreign resident ratios above 5% has tripled between 2010 and 2020.
- Rural areas like Shimukappu Village and Kawakami Village are seeing dramatic increases in their foreign populations.
- Many of these areas rely on foreign workers in tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing.
- A rise in foreign residents does not necessarily correlate with higher local tax revenues.

## 🗺️ Data Analysis and Mapping Process

- Used 2020 census data and municipal-level population datasets from Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.
- Merged the data with GeoJSON boundary files to map foreign resident ratios.
- Visualized patterns using Mapbox Studio and built a scroll-driven narrative with JavaScript.
- Highlighted notable municipalities (e.g., Shimukappu, Kawakami, Onna) with zoomed-in views and supporting visuals.

## 💡 Skills and Growth

Through this project, I gained experience in:

- Interactive web mapping using Mapbox GL JS
- Spatial data analysis and GeoJSON integration
- Scrollytelling design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Combining quantitative data with qualitative regional context
- Communicating complex demographic trends with clarity
- Assessing the local socioeconomic impacts of immigration

## 🔮 Future Work

In the future, I hope to:

- Analyze labor force participation and industry breakdowns by nationality
- Create a time-lapse animation of foreign resident growth from 2000 to 2025

# 🗾 Lede Project 2

This is the second project I’ve worked on at [Lede](https://yuta-uebayashi.github.io/Lede_project2/).

## 🏷️ Title  
**More Foreign Residents, But Is Japan Changing?**

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project investigates the rise in foreign residents across Japan’s municipalities amid an aging population and low birthrate. Using interactive maps and storytelling, it explores regional variations, economic impact, and the role of foreign labor in reshaping communities—from ski towns in Hokkaido to farming villages in Nagano and tourist resorts in Okinawa.

---

## 🔍 Findings

- Japan's overall population is declining, but the number of foreign residents is increasing.
- The number of municipalities with foreign resident ratios above 5% has tripled from 2010 to 2020.
- Rural areas like Shimukappu Village and Kawakami Village are seeing dramatic increases in foreign populations.
- Many of these areas rely on foreign workers in tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing.
- A rise in foreign residents does not necessarily correlate with higher local tax revenue.

## 🗺️ Data Analysis and Mapping Process

- Used 2020 census data and municipal-level population datasets from Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.
- Merged data with GeoJSON boundary files to map foreign resident ratios.
- Visualized patterns with Mapbox Studio and built a scroll-driven narrative using JavaScript.
- Highlighted notable municipalities (e.g. Shimukappu, Kawakami, Onna) with zoomed-in views and images.

## 💡 Skills and Growth

Through this project, I gained new skills in:

- Interactive web mapping using Mapbox GL JS
- Spatial data analysis and GeoJSON integration
- Scrollytelling design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Combining quantitative data with qualitative regional context
- Communicating complex demographic trends with clarity
- Assessing the socioeconomic impact of immigration at a local level

## 🔮 Future Work

In the future, I hope to:

- Conduct field interviews with residents and local officials in high-growth municipalities
- Analyze labor force participation and industry breakdowns by nationality
- Create a time-lapse animation of foreign resident growth from 2000 to 2025
